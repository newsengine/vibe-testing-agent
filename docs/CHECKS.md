**168** scanner checks + **10** Dynamic Business CMS critical-path checks + **5** white-box testkit helpers.

Legend — how each check reaches its verdict:

- **passive** — reads the homepage response only
- **probe** — extra safe same-origin GETs
- **active** — sends a crafted probe / burst / write
- **authenticated** — needs --cookie/--header
- **white-box** — needs source / tokens / two accounts
